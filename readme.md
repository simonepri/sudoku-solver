## Introduction to Sudoku
<img src="media/sudoku.gif" width="250" align="right" alt="Example Sudoku Board" />

Sudoku is a popular puzzle game usually played on a 9x9 board of numbers between
1 and 9.

The goal of the game is to fill the board with numbers. However, each row can
only contain one of each of the numbers between 1 and 9. Similarly, each column
and 3x3 sub-board can only contain one of each of the numbers between 1 and 9.
This makes for an engaging and challenging puzzle game.

A well-formed Sudoku puzzle is one that has a unique solution.
A Sudoku puzzle, more in general, can have more than one solution and our goal
is to enumerate them all, but this task is not always feasible.
Indeed, if we were given an empty Sudoku table, we would have to enumerate
[6670903752021072936960 solutions][ref:sudoku-board-num], and this would take
thousands of years.

### Definitions
In the following sections we will use some letters or words to refer to specific
aspects of the Sudoku problem. The following table summarizes the most important.

Term | Description
-----|------------
S | A perfect square indicating the number of columns, rows, and boxes of a Sudoku board.
N | The total number of cells of a board given as N = S * S.
Board | An instance of Sudoku represented with a S x S matrix.
Row | A row of a board's matrix that can only contain one of each of the numbers in [1, S].
Column | A column of a board's matrix that can only contain one of each of the numbers in [1, S].
Box | A particular âˆšS x âˆšS sub-matrix of a board's matrix that can only contain one of each of the numbers in [1, S].
Cell | A single entry of a board's matrix either empty or with a legal assignment.
Empty Cell | A cell whose assignment has still to be found.
Cell's Candidates | A list of values in [1, S] which can be legally placed in a particular cell.
Search Space | The productory of the candidates of all the empty cells.
Solution | An assignment of values for all the empty cells of a board that satisfies the constraints.

## Solving Algorithm
A common algorithm to solve Sudoku boards is called
[backtracking][ref:backtracking]. This algorithm is essentially a
[depth-first search][ref:dfs] in the tree of all possible guesses in the empty
cells of the Sudoku board.

### Sequential Backtracking
The sequential algorithm, that can be found in
[`src/main/java/sudoku/SequentialSolver.java`][source:sequential], is
implemented iteratively and can be summarized by the following pseudo-code.

```python
def sequential_solutions_counter(board):
  stack = []

  if board.is_full(): return 1
  (row, col) = board.get_empty_cell()
  stack.push((row, col, EMPTY_CELL_VALUE))
  for val in board.get_candidates(row, col): stack.push((row, col, val))

  count = 0
  while len(stack) > 0:
    (row, col, val) = stack.pop()
    board.set_cell(row, col, val)
    if val == EMPTY_CELL_VALUE: continue

    if board.is_full(): count += 1; continue
    (row, col) = board.get_empty_cell()
    stack.push((row, col, 0))
    for val in board.get_candidates(row, col): stack.push((row, col, val))

  return count
```

It's important to notice that the strategy used to pick the empty cell by the
`get_empty_cell` can lead to [significant reduction][ref:look-ahead] of the
total search space and thus in the time needed to enumerate all the solutions.

Another notable thing to consider is that the time complexity and space
complexity of all the operations on the board inside the while loop
(`is_full`, `set_cell`, `get_empty_cell`, `get_candidates`)
can significantly impact the overall performance of the backtracking and thus
has to be kept as efficient as possible.

More details about the computational complexity of the operations and the idea
behind their implementation can be found in the
[implementation details](#implementation-details) section.

### Parallel Backtracking
The parallel algorithm, that can be found in
[`src/main/java/sudoku/ParallelSolver.java`][source:parallel], is
implemented by parallelizing the recursive guesses of each empty cell and can be
summarized by the following pseudo-code.

```python
def parallel_solutions_counter(board, move):
  if move is not null:
    (row, col, val) = move
    board = board.clone()
    board.set_cell(row, col, val);

  if board.is_full(): return 1

  space = board.get_search_space_size()
  if space == 0: return 0
  if space <= SEQUENTIAL_CUTOFF:
    return sequential_solutions_counter(board)

  count = 0
  (row, col) = board.get_empty_cell()
  for val in board.get_candidates(row, col) paralelly:
    count += parallel_solutions_counter(board, (row, col, val))

  return count
```

The same consideration given for the
[sequential backtracking](#sequential-backtracking) also holds for the parallel
version.
In addition to those, it's worth mentioning that two new methods have been
introduced (`get_search_space_size` and `clone`).

The presence of those new methods and the creation of a thread for each branch
of the backtracking are the major cause of overhead.
The sequential algorithm is indeed used as sub-routine to speedup the
computation, when the remaining search space is below a certain threshold
empirically found.

More details about the computational complexity of the operations and the idea
behind their implementation can be found in the
[implementation details](#implementation-details) section.

## Development
Clone the repository to your local machine then cd into the directory created by
the cloning operation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonepri/sudoku-solver.git
cd sudoku-solver
```

The source code for the sudoku solver can be found in
[`src/main/java/sudoku`][source:main], while the source code for the unit tests
and the benchmarking suite can be found in [`src/test/java/sudoku`][source:test]
and [`src/benchmark`][source:benchmark] respectively.
